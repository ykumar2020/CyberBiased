"Hey grandpa, why are you even on social media? Shouldn't you be playing bingo or something?"
"I enjoy staying connected with family and friends, just like everyone else. Age shouldn't be a barrier to using technology."
"ðŸ¤£ Yeah, but it's hilarious watching old people struggle with tech. Stick to your newspapers, grandpa."
"Ugh, working with old people is the worst. They're so slow and out of touch."
That's a bit harsh. Experienced colleagues can offer valuable knowledge and perspective.
ðŸ™„ Maybe in the Stone Age. They just can't keep up with the pace of modern business.
"Hey, did you see that older person trying to use a smartphone? So cringe."
We all have different levels of tech-savviness. It's not kind to make fun of someone's skills.
It's not my fault they're dinosaurs who can't adapt.
"Why are you even trying out for the basketball team, John? Sports are for real men."
"That's unfair. Anyone should be able to participate in sports, regardless of their gender."
"But men are naturally better athletes than women. Just stick to what you're good at, like video games."
"Look at Peter crying over a movie. What a weak, emotional mess."
"There's nothing wrong with expressing emotions. Everyone has feelings, and it's okay to show them."
"Men should be strong and tough. Crying is for girls, not for guys."
"Michael, you should be the one carrying the heavy boxes. It's a man's job to do the heavy lifting."
"That's a sexist stereotype. Everyone can contribute based on their abilities, not just their gender."
"But men are physically stronger than women, so they should handle the hard work."
